# iCWLNet_Distributed_AspDotNet_C#

Microsoft Version Of Our Remote Distributing Website Builder. We can display your website on many different Servers in many different languages. The different languages are a front with the most of the programming done on our server, just the static content is looped through.
<br>
We plan to create a number of these distributed servers in the following languages:-
<br>
PHP<br>
Asp.Net C#<br>
Asp.Net Visual Basic<br>
Python<br>
Perl<br>
Ruby On The Rails<br>
C++<br>
Go<br>
JAVA<br>
Objective C<br>
Swift<br>
<br>
The remote access programming caches your content but also manages the (Session / Post/ Get / File / Cookie) Server Functions. This meens that although the content is generated remotely it displays and executes as if it was locally generated. The algorithm used is the same as load balancing applications.
<br>
I hope you like our website builder!
